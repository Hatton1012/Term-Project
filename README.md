# Project Proposal

## 1. The Big Idea
Our project aims to [describe main idea, e.g., "develop a platform to connect small businesses with local freelancers for project-based work"]. The focus will be on [mention specific topics, e.g., "efficient matching algorithms and user-friendly interfaces"]. 

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The MVP will include [e.g., "a basic matching system and user profiles for businesses and freelancers"].
- **Stretch Goal:** If time permits, we’ll aim to add [e.g., "an automated recommendation engine and analytics for users"].

## 2. Learning Objectives
We aim to deepen our understanding of [main objectives, e.g., "web development, project management, and real-time data processing"].

- **Shared Goals:** As a team, we want to learn how to [e.g., "work with agile methodologies and Git for collaborative coding"].
- **Individual Goals:** 
  - Team Member 1: Gain experience with [e.g., "backend development using Node.js"].
  - Team Member 2: Enhance skills in [e.g., "UI/UX design and frontend frameworks like React"].

## 3. Implementation Plan
Our preliminary approach involves using [mention any frameworks, libraries, or tools, e.g., "React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage"]. 

- **Exploration Areas:** We'll investigate [list any unknowns, e.g., "optimizing the matching algorithm and setting up cloud infrastructure"] and potentially consult resources on [list any tools or documentation].
  
## 4. Project Schedule
We have a rough schedule spanning 4-5 weeks:

- **Week 1:** Finalize requirements and set up project repository.
- **Week 2:** Begin core development (frontend/backend setup and basic UI design).
- **Week 3:** Implement core functionalities and integrate the frontend and backend.
- **Week 4:** Test and refine; add additional features as time allows.
- **Week 5:** Complete testing and debugging; prepare for final presentation.

This schedule is flexible and may be adjusted as the project evolves.

## 5. Collaboration Plan
Our team will adopt a mix of task delegation and pair programming, dividing tasks into [describe specific roles if any, e.g., "frontend, backend, and documentation"].

- **Communication Tools:** We plan to use [mention tools, e.g., Slack for daily communication and GitHub Projects for tracking tasks].
- **Collaboration Methodology:** We will follow an agile approach with weekly sprints to ensure we meet our deadlines. Our decision to use this approach is due to its flexibility and regular feedback loops.

## 6. Risks and Limitations
The main risk is [describe the main risk, e.g., "the complexity of the matching algorithm, which might delay development"]. 

- **Mitigation:** We’ll minimize risk by dedicating extra time to researching and prototyping critical components early in the project.

## 7. Additional Course Content
Some additional topics that may be beneficial include [mention specific topics, e.g., "advanced database management and optimization techniques"].
